# Cinders of Hope

This is a **story-driven survival game** developed by Cahel as part of a bachelor's thesis.

## Concept

The player takes on the role of a citizen trying to **escape an oppressive regime** by crossing the sea to another country. Along the way, they must survive harsh conditions, make tough choices, and uncover pieces of the game's narrative.

The game combines survival mechanics with emotional storytelling, focusing on themes of **freedom, struggle, and hope**.
